*Abstract:*
The Ecological Metadata Language (EML) defines a comprehensive, vocabulary and a readable XML markup syntax for documenting research data.  It is in widespread use in the earth and environmental sciences, and increasingly in other research disciplines as well.  EML is a community-maintained specification, and evolves to meet the data documentation needs of researchers who want to openly document, preserve, and share data and outputs.  EML includes modules for identifying and citing data packages, for describing the spatial, temporal, taxonomic, and thematic extent of data, for describing research methods and protocols, for describing the structure and content of data within sometimes complex packages of data, and for precisely annotating data with semantic vocabularies. EML includes metadata fields to fully detail data papers that are published in journals specializing in scientific data sharing and preservation.

## DOCUMENTATION

Please see the docs/index.html directory for a list of the relevant documents pertaining to EML.  In particular, this release ships with a full version of the EML Specification, which is the definitive document explaining the rules associated with the Ecological Metadata Language.

## HISTORY OF EML

EML was originally based on work done by the [ESA Committee on the Future of Long-Term Ecological Data](http://esa.sdsc.edu/FLED/FLED.html) and on a related paper on ecological metadata by Michener et al. (see Michener, William K., et al., 1997. Ecological Applications, "Nongeospatial metadata for the ecological sciences" Vol 7(1). pp. 330-342.).  Version 1.0 was released at NCEAS in 1997, with further internal releases of versions 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4, all of which followed the FLED recommendations closely in its content implementation. Version 2 was modified substantially after experience using the specification and from feedback from the ecological community, and versions 2.1 and 2.2 introduce significant new features like internationalization, semantic annotations, and support for data papers.

## VALIDATION
Some of the rules regarding EML that are important are expressed only in the EML specification, not in the XML Schema files.  This is because XML Schema was not able to express some of the constraints that we felt were important to creating a coherent metadata document, particularly with respect to identifiers and references to identifiers.  Thus, we have included a EML Validity Parser.  It checks both EML rules and the schema rules to be sure an XML document is a valid EML document.  It is included with the release, and provided as an online service. See docs/index.html.

## FILES

The files in this directory include a "docs" directory that contains the EML Specification and all documentation for the modules, and an xsd directory with an XML Schema document for each of the modules that make up EML.  Also included is a schema for supporting documentation, and an instance document defining standard attribute units for EML. The "lib/sample/eml-sample.xml" file is a sample document illustrating the use of EML. The "test" directory contains a number of sample instance documents used for testing the schemas, and an application for checking document validity under JUnit (see http://junit.org).

## RELEASE NOTES
- (see also http://github.com/NCEAS/eml/issues)

### 2.2.0

#### Major New Features

#### Schema changes:

### 2.1.1

#### Internationalization in EML 2.1.1
EML 2.1.1 introduces internationalization capabilities that can be used in most
text-based elements. Version 2.1.1 remains backward-compatible with the previous
2.1.0 release. Authors can safely upgrade existing 2.1.0 documents to 2.1.1
without altering any content, though adding additional language translations is
encouraged.

By allowing mixed element content, nested translation elements can be included
without altering or introducing ambiguity with respect to EML element
cardinality. Translation elements use standard xml:lang attributes to specify
the language used for their content. Translation elements can be nested such
that child elements may inherit or override the language used by their
ancestors. The top-level EML element may include an xml:lang attribute which
will apply to every element in the document unless a child element includes a
different xml:lang attribute to override the document default.

Multi-lingual authors of EML should carefully consider their primary target
audience when deciding the default document language. Early adopters should be
aware search tools like Metacat will require custom configuration in order to
search arbitrarily nested translations.

The internationalization feature allows authors to place any language in <value>
tags nested within most EML text fields. The xml:lang attribute should be used
to explicitly declare the language used.

Additional documentation and examples are available in the EML specification.
The i18nNonEmptyStringType is used for simple text, while i18nString for more
structured text elements.

#### Schema changes:
    - [76](https://github.com/NCEAS/eml/issues/76): internationalization needed in EML

### 2.1.0  (numbers refer to the corresponding Bugzilla bug id, not the GitHub #)
This release addresses bugs which caused the schema to be invalid with
respect to the W3C specifications using modern validators
(e.g., http://www.w3.org/2001/03/webdata/xsv). Although the changes were minor,
one was incompatible with 2.0 releases, which necessitated the version
number "2.1". In the 2.0 series, the content model for additionalMetadata
included an element <describes> whose cardinality was 0..many, alongside
<xs:any>. This construct is non-deterministic, and so a child element
was added to the additionalMetadata section to contain the <xs:any> content.
Additionally, several elements of txt:TypeText required additional
definition so that mixed content could be accommodated. These errors
were not apparent with validation software available in 2004-2005, but
were brought to light more recently. Several small changes were made to
the enumeration list and unitTypes for standard units and stmml descriptions
of customUnits. Two elements in the literature schema were allowed to be
optional so that articles-in-press could be described.  The named type for
element gRing was changed to GRingType.  

EML makes use of the STMML schema (stmml.xsd) for describing custom units
and describing its included list of standardUnits (unitList). The STMML
schema was also found to be non-deterministic, and the most reasonable fix
for this bug was not compatible with earlier versions. This error
was NOT related to elements used by EML (unitList or unitType). However,
given that authors of EML instance documents may have made use of other
parts of stmml.xsd, it was decided to the advance the namespace used for
stmml-related files to "stmml-1.1", in keeping with the pattern of version
naming in EML. The stmml authors have been contacted.
