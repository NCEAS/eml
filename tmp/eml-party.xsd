summary: The individual, organization, or role associated with a
        resource.

description: 
          
            The ResponsibleParty Type contains
        elements that are used to describe the person, organization or
        position within an organization that is associated in some way with the
        resource. It is intended to be used to fully document contact
        information for many types of associations, such as owner, manager,
        steward, curator, etc.
            Note that the content model for a responsible party type
        allows a sequence of choices for the first
        element(s): &lt;individualName&gt;, &lt;organizationName&gt; and/or &lt;positionName&gt;.
        This means that a parent element (e.g., creator) may use combinations of the 3 sub-elements
        to make up a single logical party. For example, a creator with only
                the individualName of 'Joe Smith' is NOT the same as a
                creator with the individualName of 'Joe Smith' and the
                organizationName of 'NSF'. To include both a positionName and
                 an organizationName as children of a &lt;contact&gt; implies that anyone
                currently occupying that positionName at that organizationName
                is an appropriate contact.
                The positionName should not be
                used in conjunction with individualName unless only that specific
                individual at that position would be considered appropriate for that
                designation.

summary: The full name of the individual associated with the

description: 
          
            The person Type is used to enter the salutation, and
        two types of name parts for an individual associated with the
        resource. It uses these three subfields to help parse the person's
        entire name.
             The two elements, &lt;givenName&gt;  and  &lt;surName&gt;,
             allow parsing of many types of names, even though distinct elements
             do not exist for concepts like "middle name" and "compound surname".
        &lt;givenName&gt; should be used for parts of the name that are often
        shortened to a first initial, or are not used for ordering, and typically includes
        first and middle names.
        The &lt;surName&gt; field is intended to be used for the part of the name that
        is generally displayed in its entirety and/or is alphabetized or otherwise ordered
        when appropriate. Note that only one
        &lt;surName&gt; is allowed, and is required, while &lt;givenName&gt;s are
       optional and unbounded.    
            The arrangement and content of the sub-elements is entirely
       up to the EML document's author, who presumably has first-hand knowledge of
       how the names are to be constructed. For example, if element position is important
       (e.g., the list of a book's        authors), then
       EML authors should put the creators in that order. If it is appropriate for a
       resource to have its creators sorted alphabetically, then the EML author
       should construct the name parts so that the&lt;surName&gt; field may be used for
       this purpose. At this time, EML is not able to express cultural
       conventions so that authors may indicate the correct order for
       &lt;givenName&gt;s and &lt;surName&gt; when the whole name is expressed.
       However support for international names
       is under consideration for a future version of
       EML, along with other internationalization features.

            while it is possible  to include all given names in one field (as in the

            more than one name would not be transformed correctly.
