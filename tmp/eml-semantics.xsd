summary: A semantically-precise statement about an EML element.
        

description: 
          
            The SemanticAnnotation Type contains
                elements that are used to associate a semantic statement using
                a property and value from specific formal vocabularies with
                other elements within EML.  For example, one
                might want to provide the precise set of semantic statements that
                clarify the measurement semantics of an attribute (variable)
                within a data set, or associate a specific statement with a
                data table or dataset.
                The eml-semantics module defines an 'annotation' element and
                associated type that can be used within EML resources (dataset,
                software, etc.), EML Entities (dataTable, spatialRaster,
                spatialVector, otherEntity), and EML Attributes.  They can also
                be applied within the EML additionalMetadata field to label
                arbitrary structures within EML, in which case the subject of
                the annotation is the element listed in the describes element
                within the additionalMetadata field.

tooltip: Property URI

summary: The persistent URI used to identify a property from a vocabulary.
                    

description: The URI for a property that is drawn from a controlled
                        vocabulary, and that links the subject of this annotation
                        (which is implied by its parent element) to the annotation value.
                        The propertyURI represents a semantically well-defined concept
                        that one wants to apply to an element within EML.
                        These properties should be precisely defined,
                        including defining various relationships to related concepts.
                        Property URIs are typically drawn from formal ontologies that
                        provide well-defined logical semantics and provide for various
                        types of reasoning about equivalence and overlap.
                        Property URIs should be persistent and unique over decades,
                        and the meaning of the URI should
                        be stable over time as well. These URIs are usually constructed
                        using an additional abstraction layer via link resolvers,
                        rather than directly resolving to the term definition itself.
                        Thus, when resolving the propertyURI, software user agents should
                        be prepared to follow multiple redirects before finally
                        resolving the current location of the definition.
                        However, there is no requirement that propertyURIs need to be
                        resolvable, and metadata parsers should expect to find
                        propertyURIs that do not resolve and are only used as unique
                        URIs for the property (i.e., a name).

                  the sibling propertyURI, and this valueURI element represents
                  the object.  These values should be precisely defined,

summary: A precisely-defined semantic statement.
        

description: An annotation represents a precisely-defined semantic
            statement that is used to semantically label another structure
            within EML, such as an attribute, entity, or dataset. The annotation
            is composed of a subject (implied by the element containing
            the annotation or pointed at from within eml:additionalMetadata), a
            property that defines the relationship between the
            subject and the object of the statement, and the value of that
            property. This is equivalent to RDF Statements that consist of a
            Subject, Predicate, and Object.  More concretely, the annotation
            provides a way to state that an element within EML has a specific
            property with a specific value.
