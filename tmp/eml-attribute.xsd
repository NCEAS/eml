            dataset entities
          
          
        

recommendedUsage: any dataset that uses dataTable, spatialRaster,
        spatialVector, storedProcedure, view or otherEntity or in a custom
        module where one wants to document an attribute
        (variable)

summary: Characteristics of a 'field' or 'variable' in a data
        entity (ie. dataTable).

description: The content model for attribute is a CHOICE between
        "references" and all of the elements that let you describe the
        attribute (e.g., attributeName, attributeDefinition, precision). The
        attribute element allows a user to document the characteristics that
        describe a 'field' or 'variable' in a data entity (e.g. dataTable).
        Complete attribute descriptions are perhaps the most important aspect
        to making data understandable to others. An attribute element describes
        a single attribute or an attribute element can contain a reference
        to an attribute defined elsewhere. Using a reference means that the
        referenced attribute is (semantically) identical, not just in name
        but identical in its complete description. For example, if attribute
        "measurement1" in dataTable "survey1" has a precision of 0.1 and
        you are documenting dataTable survey2 which has an attribute called
        "measurement1" but the survey2's measurement1 has a precision of
        0.001 then these are different attributes and must be described
        separately.

description: Attribute name is official name of the

              that is used to refer to the attribute.  Many systems have
              restrictions on the length of attribute names, and on the
              use of special characters like spaces in the name, so the
              attribute name is often not particularly useful for display
              (use attributeLabel for display).  The attributeName is
              usually the name of the variable that is found in the header
              of a data file.

summary: Storage type hint for this field

description: This element describes the storage type,
              for data in a RDBMS (or other data management system) field.
              As many systems do not
              provide for fine-grained restrictions on types, this type will
              often be a superset of the allowed domain defined in
              attributeDomain. Values for this field are by default drawn from
              the XML Schema Datatypes standard values, such as: integer,
              double, string, etc. If the XML Schema Datatypes are not used,
              the type system from which the values are derived should be
              listed in the 'typeSystem' attribute described below. This field
              represents a 'hint' to processing systems as to how the attribute
              might be represented in a system or language, but is distinct
              from the actual expression of the domain of the attribute. The
              field is repeatable so that the storageType can be indicated for
              multiple type systems (e.g., Oracle data types and Java data
              types).

                    without specifying the magnitude of the difference between
                    values. Ordinal is used when the categories have
                    a logical or ordered relationship to each other. These
                    types of scale allow one to distinguish the order
                    of values, but not the magnitude of the difference
                    between values. An example of an ordinal scale is a
                    categorical survey where you rank a variable 1=good,
                    2=fair, 3=poor.

description: 
                      The dateTime field is used for defining the
                    characteristics of the attribute if it contains
                    date and time values. DateTime is used when the values
                    fall on the Gregorian calendar system.  DateTime values
                    are special because they have properties of interval
                    values (most of the time it is legitimate to treat them
                    as interval values by converting them to a duration from
                    a fixed point) but they sometimes only behave as ordinals
                    (because the calendar is not predetermined, for some
                    dateTime values one can only find out the order of
                    the points and not the magnitude of the duration
                    between those points).  Thus, the dateTime scale provides
                    the information necessary to properly understand and
                    parse date and time values without improperly
                    labeling them under one of the more traditional scales.
                      Date and time values are unlike any other measured values.
                      Note that the dateTime field would not be used if
              one is recording time durations.  In that case, one should use a
              standard unit such as seconds, nominalMinute or nominalDay, or a
              customUnit that defines the unit in terms of its relationship to
              SI second.

                            the date or time value.  To describe the format
                            of an attribute containing dateTime values,
                            construct a string representation of the format
                            using the following symbols:
                            
                            
                              
              Y   year
              M   month
              W   month abbreviation (e.g., JAN)
              D   day
              h   hour
              m   minute
              s   second
              T   time designator (demarcates date and time parts of date-time)
              Z   UTC designator, indicating value is in UTC time
              .   indicates a decimal fraction of a unit
              +/- indicates a positive or negative number,
                  or a positive or negative time zone adjustment relative to UTC
              -   indicates a separator between date components
              A/P am or pm designator
              
                            
                            
              Any other character in the format string is interpreted as a
              separator character.  Here are some examples of the format
              strings that can be constructed.

              Some notes about these examples.  First, the ISO 8601 standard is
              strict about the date components, their order, and the separators;
              e.g., date parts are upper case, and time parts are lower case.
              If no UTC relation information is given, the time is assumed to be in local
              time. Assuming local time is ambiguous even when communicating within a
              single time zone, given variations in Daylight Saving Time.
              Best practice is to follow the ISO 8601 format precisely and accurately.
                            
                            
              In particular, please note that these are all non-standard
                according to ISO:
              
                use of a slash (/) to separate date components,
                a space to separate date and time components,
                using a twelve-hour time with am/pm designator,
                placing any of the components out of descending order
              
                            
                            

              However, we recognize that existing data contain
              non-standard dates, and existing equipment (e.g., sensors) may
              still be producing non-standard dates.
              Further, data parsers often apply individual interpretations. E.g., Java
              interprets HH on a 24-hr clock and hh on a 12-hr clock, and MM as a
              padded integer for month but MMM as a 3-letter abbreviation.
              Consequently, the formatting string can contain characters as needed
               to accommodate existing data.
              
                            
              Decimal dateTime values can be extended by indicating in
              the format that additional decimals can be used.  Only the final
              unit (e.g., seconds in a time value) can use the extended digits
              according to the ISO 8601 standard.  For example, to show
              indicate that seconds are represented to the nearest 1/1000
              of a second, the format string would be "hh:mm:ss.sss".
              Note that this only indicates the number of decimals used to
              record the value, and not the precision of the measurement
              (see dateTimePrecision for that).
              
                            
              Date and time values are from an interval scale, but it is extremely
              complex because of the vagaries of the calendar (e.g., leap
              years, and leap seconds).  The duration between date and time values
              in the future is not even deterministic because leap seconds are
              based on current measurements of the earth's orbit. Consequently,
              date and time values are unlike any other measured values.  The format
              string for dateTime values allows one to accurately calculate the
              duration in SI second units between two measured dateTime values,
              assuming that the conversion software has a detailed knowledge of
              the Gregorian calendar.

summary: An indication of the precision of a
                          date or time value

description: A quantitative indication of
                          the precision of a date or time measurement.
                          The precision should be interpreted in the
                          smallest units represented by the dateTime format.
                          For example, if a dateTime value has a format of
                          "hh:mm:ss.sss", then "seconds" are the smallest unit
                          and the precision should be expressed in seconds.
                          Thus, a precision value of "0.01" would mean that
                          measurements were precise to the nearest hundredth
                          of a second, even though the format string might
                          indicate that values were written down with 3
                          decimal places.

summary: The name of a standard unit used to make this
            measurement

description: Use the standardUnit element if the unit for this attribute has
            been defined in the Standard Unit Dictionary.
            The list of "standard" units includes the SI base units and many compound units based
            on SI, plus and some commonly used units which are not SI. The list is by no means
            exhaustive. If the unit you need is not part of this list, then the customUnit field should be used
            instead. Standard units have been described using STMML. See the documentation
            for the Type for more information.

tooltip: Precision

summary: The precision of the measurement.

description: Precision indicates how close together or how
        repeatable measurements are.  A precise measuring instrument will give
        very nearly the same result each time it is used. This means that
        someone interpreting the data should expect that if a measurement were
        repeated, most measured values would fall within the interval specified
        by the precision. The value of precision should be expressed in the
        same unit as the measurement. For example, for an attribute with unit
        "meter", a precision of "0.1" would be interpreted to mean that most
        repeat measurements would fall within an interval of 1/10th of a meter.

summary: 

description: The non-numeric domain field describes the domain
        of the attribute being documented.  It can describe two
        different types of domains: enumerated and text.  Enumerated
        domains are lists of values that are explicitly provided as
        legitimate values.  Only values from that list should occur
        in the attribute.  They are often used for response codes
        such as "HIGH" and "LOW".  Text domains are used for attributes
        that allow more free-form text fields, but still permit some
        specification of the value-space through pattern matching.  A
        text domain is usually used for comment and notes attributes,
        and other character attributes that don't have a precise set of
        constrained values. This is an important field for post processing
        and error checking of the dataset. It represents a formal
        specification of the value space for the attribute, and so there
        should never be a value for the attribute that falls outside of
        the set of values prescribed by the domain.

summary: Definition of what this text domain

description: The element definition provides the
                    text domain definition, that is, what kinds of text
                    expressions are allowed for this attribute. If there
                    is a pattern supplied, the definition element
                    expresses the meaning of the pattern, For example, a
                    particular pattern may be meant to represent phone
                    numbers in the US phone system format. A definition
                    element may also be used to extend an enumerated
                    domain.

summary: Regular expression pattern constraining
                    the attribute

description: The pattern element specifies a
                    regular expression pattern that constrains the set of
                    allowable values for the attribute. This is commonly
                    used to define template patterns for data such as
                    phone numbers where the attribute is text but the
                    values are not drawn from an enumeration. If the
                    pattern field is empty or missing, it defaults to
                    '.*', which matches any string, including the empty
                    string. Repeated pattern elements are combined using
                    logical OR. The regular expression syntax is the same
                    as that used in the XML Schema Datatypes
                    Recommendation from the W3C.

                    in the US. In other cases, the coding may be a
                    researcher's custom way of recording and classifying
                    their data, and no external "source" would

        numericDomain and in precision together constitute
        sufficient information to decide upon an appropriate
        system specific data type for representing a particular
        attribute. For example, an attribute with a numeric domain
        from 0-50,000 and a precision of 1 could be represented in
        the C language using a 'long' value, but if the precision is
        changed to '0.5' then a 'float' type would be needed.
