              The eml-access module - Access control rules for resources
            
          
        

recommendedUsage: all data where controlling user access to the
        dataset is an issue

summary: The rules defined in this element will determine the level
        of access to a resource for the defined users and groups.

description: The access element contains a list of rules defining
        permissions for this resource. For descriptions of the individual elements,
        see the AccessType.The permission rules defined here can be overridden
         by rules added to an access tree in the PhysicalDistributionType
        at the entity level.

tooltip: Access control rules

summary: The rules defined in this element will determine the level
        of access to a resource for the defined users and groups.

description: The access element contains a list of rules that define
        the level of access for a resource. There are two uses of access trees: to
        control access to either metadata or data. To control access to metadata
        use the eml/access tree. By default, these rules will also apply to the contained
        data. To override the default controls for specific data entities, use the
        access element available in the entity's physical/distribution tree.  A
        combination of access trees and their "order rules" (see description of
        the "order" attribute) allows EML authors
        to have fine control over permissions for individuals and groups.

summary: The order in which the allow and deny rules should be

description: To obtain the desired access control, use the order
          attribute to define which rules should be applied first. The acceptable
          values are 'allowFirst' and 'denyFirst'. If 'allowFirst' is
          specified, then all 'allow' rules are processed, and then overridden
          by all 'deny' rules.  If 'denyFirst' is specified, then all 'deny'
          rules are processed, and then overridden by all 'allow' rules.

summary: The authentication system is used to verify the user or
          group to whom access is allowed or denied.

description: The authentication system determines the set of
          principals (users + groups) that can be used in the access control
          list, and the membership of users in groups. This element is intended
          to provide a reference to the authentication system that is used to
          verify the user or group. This reference is typically in the form
          of a URI, which includes the connection protocol, Internet host, and
          path to the authentication mechanism.

summary: Access Rules define a user's access to a

description: The AccessRule type defines a list of users that are
        derived from a particular authentication system (such as an LDAP
        directory), whether the user or group is allowed or denied access, the
        extent of their access (read, write , or changePermission
        access).

summary: The user or group (principal) for which the access
            control applies.

description: The principal element defines the user or group to
            which the access control rule applies. The users and groups must be
            defined in the authentication system described in the authSystem
            element.  The special principal 'public' can be used to indicate
            that any user or group has a particular access permission, thereby
            making it easier to specify that anonymous access is allowed.

description: 
              
                
            The permission that is being granted or denied
            to a particular user or group for a given resource. The list of
            permissions come from a predetermined list:
            
                'read' - allow or deny viewing of the resource, 
                'write' - allow or deny modification of the resource (except for access rules),  
                'changePermission' - modifications including access rules, and  
                'all' - all of the above. 
                

                This element also allows other permission values that may be applicable to some other authentication systems but are not defined in this specification (if these other values are used, access rule enforcement is indeterminate outside of the originating system).
