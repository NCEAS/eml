                        Variable width format fields (attributes) can vary in their 
                        field length, thus the end of the field is 
                        delimited by a special character called a 
                        field delimiter (typically a comma or a space).

                        Data sets are generally classified as fixedWidth
                        format or variableWidth format, but we have
                        determined that this is actually a per-field
                        classification because one may encounter
                        fixedWidth fields mixed together in the same
                        data file with variableWidth fields.
                        
                        In our encoding scheme, the start of each field
                        is assumed to be the column after the last column
                        of the previous field, or the first column
                        if this is the first field in the dataset, unless 
                        the starting column is explicity enumerated using the
                        "fieldStartColumn" element.
                        The end column for each field is classified
                        using either a special character delimeter indicated
                        using the filedDelimiter element,
                        or a fixed field length indicated by using the "fieldWidth"
                        element.  The delimiter for the last field in the data set can be omitted.
                        variableWidth fields can vary in their field length, and the end of
                        the field is delimited by a special character
                        called a field delimiter, usually a comma or
                        a tab character.  fixedWidth fields have a set
                        length, and so the end of the field can always
                        be determined by adding the fieldWidth to the
                        starting column number.  Here is an example:
                        
                        Assume we have the following data in a data set:

                        May,100aaaa,1.2,
                        April,200aaaa,3.4,
                        June,300bbbb,4.6,

                        The metadata indicating the physical layout of the 4 fields would include the 
                        following:

                          <delimiter>,</delimiter>
                          <fieldWidth>3</fieldWidth>
                          <fieldWidth>3</fieldWidth>
                          <delimiter>,</delimiter>

                        In a strictly fixed format file, the metadata would be slightly different:

                        May100aaaa1.2
                        Apr200aaaa3.4
                        Jun300bbbb4.6

                          <fieldWidth>3</fieldWidth>
                          <fieldWidth>3</fieldWidth>
                          <fieldWidth>4</fieldWidth>
                          <fieldWidth>3</fieldWidth>           

                        or, one could explicitly describe the starting columns:
                
                          <fieldStartColumn>1</fieldStartColumn>
                          <fieldWidth>3</fieldWidth>
                          <fieldStartColumn>4</fieldStartColumn>
                          <fieldWidth>3</fieldWidth>
                          <fieldStartColumn>7</fieldStartColumn>
                          <fieldWidth>4</fieldWidth>
                          <fieldStartColumn>11</fieldStartColumn>
                          <fieldWidth>3</fieldWidth>
